# Charles Green

I'm an experienced entrepreneur and technologist with a few [degrees](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesgreen) up my sleeve.

Over the last 15 years I’ve started multiple IT firms, worked as a technologist for investment banks and consulting firms in Asia Pacific. Specifically, in the last 8 years I’ve been living and working in Tokyo as an IT Architect and DevOp building large distributed real-time transaction systems.

I've also been focusing on helping start-ups disrupt the status quo in how business gets done in Asia Pacific. And when I am not focusing on business and technology I also enjoy traveling, wine, writing, and learning new languages.
