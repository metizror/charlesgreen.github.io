# Charles Green

I'm an experienced entrepreneur with an MBA and BSc CIS from Baker College where I was also an adjunct instructor and an Advisory Board Member in computer science.

Over the last 15 years I've started multiple IT related firms and worked for financial and consulting firms in Asia Pacific. For the last 8 years I've been working in Tokyo as an Architect and Senior DevOps Engineer building large distributed systems, real-time data transaction systems, and automated reporting systems in public and private cloud environments.

I've also been increasing my focus away from working with only large enterprise clients and more towards working with startups with the overall goal of disrupting the flow of business and how things get done in Asia Pacific.

Lastly, when I am not focusing on business and technology I also enjoy traveling, writing, and learning new languages.
