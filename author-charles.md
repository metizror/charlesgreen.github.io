# Charles Green

I'm an experienced technical entrepreneur with an MBA and Bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems from Baker College where he was also an adjunct instructor and an Advisory Board member in computer science.

Over the last 15 years I've started multiple IT related firms and worked for financial and technology firms in Asia Pacific. For the last 8 years he has worked in Tokyo, Japan as a Lead DevOps Engineer and Team Lead for leading Japanese investment banks and founded new startups where he has build large distributed systems, real-time data transaction systems, and automated reporting systems in public and private cloud environments.

In the last couple of years I've increased my focus on working with the startup community in Tokyo.
