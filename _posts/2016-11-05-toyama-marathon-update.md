I had a great October wrap up with completing the Toyama Marathon on Halloween and to make things even better I had a chance to take in the sights and enjoy a more traditional side of Japan.  

In this post I'd like to recap a bit of my trip, touch on a few lessons learned from my second marathon, and outline upcoming races. Yes, that's races with an 's'. I've just recently signed up for the [Nagano Marathon](http://www.naganomarathon.gr.jp) in April 2017 with another event most likely sneaking in sometime between now and then.


## Destination Toyama

Separate from the marathon I found Toyama to be good fun and visitor friendly. It was also a good change from the day-to-day in Tokyo with lots of small but noticeable differences. Landing at the airport and taking the bus into town I first noticed the vast amounts of space, trees, grass, and rivers that I just don't get the chance to see in Tokyo. Then after spending a bit more time there I started noticing more subtle differences like trams instead of trains, many more people driving instead of walking, and less people trying to speak English everywhere I went. It might sound strange but most places I go in Tokyo generally make it difficult to speak Japanese.

It was also the first time for me to see a car drive service that people can use instead of drinking and driving.  Parked along the street in bar and entertainment areas you'll find what looks like a taxi but with two people instead of one. The idea is that if you want to drink you can hire the team to drive you and your car home at the end of the night.

While there I was able to see Toyama Castle and museum, the observatory in the city hall and a wonderful boardwalk but I skipped the boat ride to the sea. It's easy to see that the city's working hard to attract both Japanese and foreign travelers. They even have an English speaking tourist center at the Shinkansen station with English maps and mapped out walking routes. It was much more like a travel agency then a free tourist center.


## Toyama Marathon

For any first time marathoners or for anyone looking for a wonderful and well executed event and a generous 7 hour cut off time then Toyama should be on your short list. This year's race had 13,000+ runners and what seemed like just as many volunteers. Not to mention far more spectators than I ever expected. It was like everyone took the day off and came out to to join us. It was great and I look forward to running it again next year.

## Race results

As for my specific results in the race I fell flat in training and in my diet. I fell short by letting my schedule and other things get in the way. With that said I'm still happy that was able to finish even with a time of 6:37:59. On the bright side it was within 2 minutes of my time in the 2010 Tokyo Marathon.

I completed the first 20km in 3:10 however my pace got away from me during the second half when my Apple watch battery died and I wasn't able to monitor my pace. Other than that I felt great and finished the race with a smile on my face.

To make things more interesting over the coming months the cut off times for races is getting much shorter. With 7 hours the Toyama Marathon was a good starting point. Up next in Saitama, with a 6 hour limit, it will be much more difficult but nowhere near as challenging as the 5 hour limited in Nagano. Regardless, it should be good times pushing myself in speed as well as distance over the coming months.


## Planned Improvements - Saitama Marathon Preparation

With little or rather no time to train between events I'm looking to try and cut 38 minutes off my time through the use of tech and strategy. With a new [Garmin ForerunnerÂ® HR](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-230/prod523893.html) I should be able to track my pace from start to finish. That combined with following something akin to the walk-run method, alternating between higher intensity and a slower recovery pace, I believe I still have a shot in finishing before the 6 hour cut off time.

Other than that I've taken a few short 5km recovery runs this week with two more scheduled. One on Monday and the last on Wednesday. After that I'll limit outings to only casual walks.  I'll keep you posted on my progress and final results. If you have any ideas or recommendations please let me know.
