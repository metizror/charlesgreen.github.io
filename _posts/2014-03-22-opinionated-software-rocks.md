I’ll take opinionated over indifferent every day of the week. In software development while coming from the Windows world I’d still take a single app with a very specific purpose like you find with Linux over larger more feature rich applications 9 times out of 10.  

Why you ask. The answer is quite simple. By focusing on a single purpose with limited use cases developers are able to remove bloat and the need to try and solve all the world's problems with a single app. This in turn reduces the chances of bugs and unexpected behavior. It also simplifies long-term support and dependencies on other 3rd party applications. Last but far from least it gives the ability to mix and match functionality while reducing the chances of making mediocre software that does a lot of things but nothing really well.

To tie that back to home, I’m using this core concept with all projects developed in SimplyCubed. It’s opinionated with well-defined ideas about how things should be done. Where possible projects will also be open so people can pick and chose the different parts they want to use without being tied to any single solution or implementation. Some pieces can be used while others are tossed out and replaced with something more suitable for their specific needs.

Are you working on an opinionated software project? If so, I’d like to hear from you at [@charles_green](http://www.twitter.com/charles_green).
