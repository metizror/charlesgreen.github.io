Wanted to give a quick training update. With all new things, the first and most difficult challenge can be found in changing one's habits and behaviors. At least for me, this is always the case.   

**Mental Shift**  
My goal is to get fit and to develop an overall healthy lifestyle. For some this might be an exciting goal but personally, it doesn't sound quite sexy enough. As such I needed to spice it up a bit and make it larger than life and a lot more exciting. Completing not just one but rather two full marathons within the next 5 months does it for me.

**Getting it Done**  
Now comes the "getting it done" part. When I ran my first marathon back in 2010 I discovered a wonderful and foolproof trick. I simply told everyone I knew that I was going to do it. And with friends like mine, it would have been much more painful to not prepare and finish the race than to just do the work. They sure are a great group of guys and gals.

**Training Program**  
Once I registered for my first event a friend recommended RunKeeper. I quickly signed up for the premium Go plan and have been enjoying it ever since.

I first set a few goals. Specifically, I registered the first marathon (Toyama Marathon) and found a training program. It's a 16-week training course so I simply set my marathon date and the application did all the hard work of calculating the training start date. Next, I realized I had a few weeks before the training started so I simply set a different goal of running 10km within 65 minutes and found a training program to use until the marathon training started. This way the app simply tells me how often and far to run. I just need to focus on showing up for the party. Lastly, I set a weight goal and while fat percentage might be a better metric it works for now and is also trackable within the site.

**Until Next Time**  
Thus far I am a few weeks in and things are going well. I highly recommend finding friends to run with and downloading the RunKeeper mobile app. Without running with others at different times and sharing my status on social media I wouldn't have nearly as much motivation to keep going.

Thanks everyone for your help and I look forward to continuing my training along with you. I'm down to 124 days and counting. I'll keep you posted on my progress.

On [RunKeeper.com](http://runkeeper.com/user/charlesgreen)? If so, feel free to add me. Perhaps we can go on a run together if you're in Tokyo.
