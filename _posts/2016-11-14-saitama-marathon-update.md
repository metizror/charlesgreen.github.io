I had a good race but came up short in Saitama. While I was only able to finish the first 21km before missing the time gate I was extremely happy with being able to cut 29 minutes off my 20km run for a new personal best (2:41).

In this post I will touch on the day trip to Saitama, a couple lessons learned and a few quick words to recap my new [Garmin Forerunner 230](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-230/prod523893.html) and [Soft Strap Premium Heart Rate Monitor](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/shop-by-accessories/fitness-sensors/soft-strap-premium-heart-rate-monitor/prod15490_010-10997-07.html). I'll finish up with a few bullet points of coming races including the [Nagano Marathon](http://www.naganomarathon.gr.jp) in April 2017 and a [Spartan Race](https://www.spartan.com/) (obstacle course) in the US that I'm considering in 2017.


## Destination Saitama

Sitting about 1 hour straight north of Meguro, Saitama is a bit of hike but definitely doable for a day trip. For the most part, it looks like downtown Tokyo with 30 story buildings and a large stadium. The city itself is very accessible with lots of layers. If you're going there with people it's advisable to pick a meeting spot in case you get separated as doing so over text or phone afterwards can be difficult as it's a very large place.


## Saitama Marathon

With a lot of small peaks and valleys, the course is far from boring but it does double back over itself so it's kind of like running the same route twice. There was also a good number of spectators and volunteers. Many thanks to everyone who helped make the day possible.

While the experience was mostly positive there were a few disappointments.  Perhaps this is a carry over from the wonderful  experience in Toyama but I was surprised by all the queuing, lack of facilities and most of all lack of food and water along the course.  

There were multiple times when I would get to a water station and find that they were completely out of supplies or worse yet to get to where a water station was and find it completely closed.  If it were free I could understand there being a limited supply however at JPY 10,000 (approx. US$100) to take part in the race there is simply no acceptable excuse.

Perhaps I should chalk this up to inexperience as it is only the 2nd Saitama Marathon but either way I will most likely skip it next year.

## Race Results

Overall I was only able to complete 21.2km of the 42.192km (26.2 miles) race before missing the cutoff time needed to clear the 6th time gate (discussed more in lessons learned). And while it was a disappointment not to be able to continue running and finish the race I was very happy to have pushed hard and cut 29 minutes off my 20km time to establish a new personal best.

Race Stats:  
- Time: 2:54
- Average Pace: 8:12/km

Personal Bests:  
- 10km 1:15:43  
- 15km 1:56:56  
- 20km 2:41:21  


## Lessons Learned

1. For those new to marathons like I am, it's useful to know that the race organizers place time cutoff points at different areas along the course. For example, this race had 10 gates and depending on the allocated time for the race and the position of the gates each one has a max passing time. If you pass within the allocated time then you can keep running. If not, you are forced to stop and you get a ride to the finish line. Personally, I found this a bit frustrating but I understand that the organizers need to ensure that the race is able to finish on time, all runners are able to make it back safely, and the roads are reopened on time.  

2. Race start and end times are the same for everyone regardless of when you actually cross the starting line. This is something I should have realized but I simply overlooked going into this race. With a time limit of 6 hours, this race was 38 minutes shorter than my finishing time in Toyama. My oversight was that I thought it was a cutoff time from when you started to when you had to finish the race but I didn't realize it was from when the sound of the starting gun. This means that whether you are at the start of the pack in group A or at the back in group G you have the same amount of time to cross the finish line. In order words, if you are at the back and start the race 15 or 20 minutes later than the people at the front then you simply have less time to finish the race.


## New Garmin Tech

As an everyday watch the Garmin 230 takes a little getting used to but after turning off all of the notifications, beeps, buzzes, etc. it's starting to grow on me.

On race day, however, it was awesome and it outperformed all of my expectations. It was quick to connect the Heart Rate Monitor (HRM) and enable the GPS. Best of all after 3 hours the battery was still at 90% which was a nice change from my Apple Watch and iPhone 5s which only lasted 3 hours in my last race.

It is definitely a must have for anyone running a long race. I can thank the pace feature for helping me cut so much time off my run. The only other piece of tech I am looking for is for a small iPod Shuffle so I don't have to carry my phone just to listen to music. Other than that I'm all tech'ed out.


## Planned Improvements - Nagano Preparation

Over the last couple of races, my times have needed to increase drastically in order to finish on time. Starting at 7 hours Toyama was generous and I could focus on simply finishing the race. Then came Saitama at 6 hours. Still almost doable but definitely difficult at my current health and weight.

Next up is the Nagano Marathon at 5 hours. I now have no choice but to shed 20-30kg work on both my endurance as well as speed drills. To help with this I'm looking at [McMillan Running](https://www.mcmillanrunning.com/) for either a custom training plan or monthly online coaching as this race will be my first real test and I want to give it my all.
