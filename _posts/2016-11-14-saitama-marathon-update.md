I had a good race but came up short in Saitama. While I was only able to finish the first 20km before missing the closing gate I was happy with being able to cut 29 minutes off my 20km run for a new personal best (2:41).

As this marathon was only a day trip this post will be a bit shorter than the Toyama trip.  I'll also touch on a couple lessons learned and give a quick recap of how my new [Garmin Forerunner 230](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-230/prod523893.html) and [Soft Strap Premium Heart Rate Monitor](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/shop-by-accessories/fitness-sensors/soft-strap-premium-heart-rate-monitor/prod15490_010-10997-07.html). I'll also bullet point up coming races touching on the [Nagano Marathon](http://www.naganomarathon.gr.jp) in April 2017 and a [Spartan Race](https://www.spartan.com/) (obstacle course) that I'm thinking of doing in 2017 (TBD).


## Destination Saitama

Sitting about 1 hour straight north of Meguro, Saitama is a bit of hike but definitely doable for a day trip.


## Toyama Marathon

With a lot of small peaks and valleys the course is far from boring. There was also a good number of spectators and volunteers. While mostly positive there were a few disappointments. After such a wonderful experience in Toyama and how well it was organized I was a little surprised by all the queuing, lack of facilities (considering it was a stadium) and most of all lack of water and food along the course. There were times when I would get to a water station and either it was already closed or they were completely out of water. As this was only the second Saitama marathon I'm going to chalk it up to being inexperienced. At this point I don't know if I will do this race again. I'll most likely skip it next year.

## Race results

Overall I was only able to complete 21.2km of the race before missing a cut off time needed to continue.
And while it was a disappointment not to continue I was very happy with cutting 29 minutes off my 20km run two weeks ago in Toyama.

Race Stats:  
- Time: 2:54
- Average Pace: 8:12/km

Personal Bests:  
- 10km 1:15:43  
- 15km 1:56:56  
- 20km 2:41:21  

## New Garmin Tech

As an everyday watch the Garmin 230 will take a little getting used to but after turning off all of the notifications, beeps, buzzes, etc. it's starting to grow on me.

On race day, it was awesome and it over performed. It was quick to connect the HRM and enable the GPS. Best of all after 3 hours the battery was still at 90% which was a nice change from my Apple Watch and iPhone 5s which only lasted to the halfway point in Toyama.

It is definitely a must have for anyone running a long race. I can thank the pace feature for helping me cut so much time off my run.

The only other piece of tech I am looking for is for a small iPod shuffle so I don't have to carry my phone just to listen to music. Other than that I'm all teched out.


## Planned Improvements - Nagano Preparation

Over the last couple of races my times have needed to increase drastically in order to finish on time. Starting at 7 hours Toyama was generous and I could focus on simply finishing the race. Then came Saitama at 6 hours. Still doable but definitely a stretch at my current health and weight.  Next up is the Nagano Marathon at 5 hours. I now have no choice but to shed some weight and work on both my endurance as well as speed drills. To help with this I'm looking at [McMillan Running](https://www.mcmillanrunning.com/) for either a custom training plan or monthly online coaching as this race will be my first real test and I want to give it my all.
