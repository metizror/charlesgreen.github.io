Do you ever wake up in the middle of the night or hours before your alarm goes off with a craving? A desire so great that it's all consuming. It's like the desire to breath when you've been underwater for far too long.

As I’ve been cutting away at the distractions in my life and focusing more and more on my driving principles something unexpected happened. Not only has my focus gotten stronger but my overall desire and craving to succeed has as well.  This is the thirst that wakes me at night or after just a few hours of sleep. And while I have never needed much sleep in the past I now sleep deeper and wake up more rested on even less.  

## Getting Past Roadblocks
This also got me thinking about childhood. I grew up asking myself what I wanted to do with my life or for a living.  Personally this has always been too difficult of a question to answer. First, because I like way to many things to pick just one. Second, for life just seemed like the risk of picking the wrong thing would have long lasting consequences. As a last resort I changed my question and started focusing on trying to find something that I could stand to do for the next 6 to 12 months instead. I also want into it with the expectation that afterwards I could change my mind and pick something new. While on the surface this sounds like commonsense it was a profound mental shift for me when it happened.

## Sharping Skills  
Over the years I have learned new skills including tech skills with programming everything from mobile and web apps to backend financial systems. Interviewed over 2000 engineers hiring just over 50. I also managed teams and taught approximately 850 mathematics and technology students a week for 5 years. Lastly, I've launched and ran a few different companies over the years and had to focus on the sales and delivery sides as well. And while all of these might seem out of place they have geared me up for my next challenge.

## Unstoppable Drive  
What’s next you might ask? For me it’s growth. It’s on continually refining my skills and driving significant growth for every project and organization I work with.  It is with raising the bar and holding myself to a much higher standard and making the world a much better place along the way.
