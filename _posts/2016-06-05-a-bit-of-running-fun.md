I have some awesome news. I just signed up for my 2nd marathon.

The first one was a long time ago...the 2010 Tokyo Marathon. And while it has been a while it's now time to dust off the shoes and get back into the game again.

Next up is the [2nd Saitama International Marathon](http://saitama-international-marathon.jp/) on Sunday, November 12th. From today I have 160 days (5 months and 7 days) to prepare.

There are slots still available if you are up for a challenge and care to join me.

The game is on!
