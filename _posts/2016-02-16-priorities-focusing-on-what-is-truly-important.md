It was shocking! I've been doing it all wrong! 

What you ask? Life.

You see, recently I've been thinking a lot about values, priorities, and what I care about. And I came to the conclusion that I have been focusing on the wrong things and putting other peoples values ahead of mine. 

Sure careers are important, titles are a great nice to have, and challenging work can be a lot of fun but at the end of the day, none of it means anything if you're left feeling stuck, frustrated, defensive, and left wanting. 

Instead of the problem, I am the type of person that puts all my person behind improving it. And in this case the change is simple. 

It's taking back control of my present life, living my values, mapping out my future direction.  It's being able taking the time to improve my health and enjoy life again. It is also about breaking away from the idea of trading time and life instead of value for money. 

One of my professors used to say, "you got to reach out and grab it by the horns" and while he was talking about Oracle databases I think the same thing applies to life, love, growth, and happiness. Most of all it applies to life and one's ability to pick their future direction. Today is the marking of a new era.
