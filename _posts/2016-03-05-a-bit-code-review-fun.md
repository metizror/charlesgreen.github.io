It might sound a bit strange but having a good worklow makes life so much better. 

In business this is having a well structured way of communicating, setting expectations, getting things done, measuring results and finally closing the loop with feedback. 

In the software development and engineering worlds this tends to focus in on having the right systems in place for tracking everything from capturing requirements with user stories to implementation, to quality control, and then finally into the support phase. 

When the systems in place are well oiled and running smoothly it can be a highly productive and wonderful place to be in however when their are gaps life becomes painful. And the more people you add to the mix the worse it gets until the the whole system breaks and everything grinds to a halt.  

If and when you catch yourself in this situation (it's guaranteed to happen at least once). I believe the only way to come out is to force time for improvements. This will most likely result in pushed off deadlines, watching work get backed, disappointed stakeholders, etc. but at the end of the day the only way to fix it is to first focus on fixing and filling the gaps at the core of the problem. After things are resolved the backup will disapear and you and your team will be able to make it back to the good place once again. 

The area that I am trying to improve today has to do with Code Reviews. To help with this I am experimenting with a few tools to help teams work better together. For most projects I have been doing code reviews after the initial push into a shared dev branch before it is pulled into staging and then production however with [Review Ninja](https://app.review.ninja) I am looking at ways to improve code reviews earlier in the the process. Using [Git Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) helps to set a standard for the team to work with. Part of the challenge however it to make sure that everyone on the team has the needed Git skills are fully understand the process.
