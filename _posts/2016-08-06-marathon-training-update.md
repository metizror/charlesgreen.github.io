This update is a little different. As the big marathon days get closer I've started to plan, execute, and track my weekly training sessions. I've also made a drastic improvement with my diet. To top it off I've also started to dip my toe into triathlon training and added a mix of swimming into my training but more on that later.


As briefly discussed in my last update, the biggest change has actually been mental rather than physical. I've found that once I committed to myself and others it's been much easier to improve and follow through with my training and diet. While there are still times when I don't follow through and get the training done it's becoming the exception rather than the norm. At first I credited this to telling everyone I know about my plans but now I've started to develop an internal drive where I just feel better when I get it done. In short, I now have both an external pull as well as an internal push to train and improve.


Along with learning more about physical training and diet I'm learning more about tools and gadgets that make the fun analytics side of training easier and a bit more fun. For example, when I first started running I was using [RunKeeper](http://www.RunKeeper.com) which worked very well. It's a good app with nice training programs but after expanding my training from only marathons to triathlons (swim, bike, run) it left me wanting so I moved to [Strava](http://wwww.strava.com) and I'm now tracking swimming and I'll soon add cycling.

I've also started tracking my eating and overall diet with [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com). It's an exceptional application with a huge database of barcodes and product information which makes it extremely fast and easy to track macronutrients in addition to calories. Living in Japan I've found this the only app that has done a very good job including both western as well as Japanese food in a single place.

Thanks everyone for your help and I look forward to continuing my training along with you. I'm down to 84 days and counting. I'll keep you posted on my progress.

On [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/16169520)? If so, feel free to add me. Perhaps we can go on a run together if you're in Tokyo.
