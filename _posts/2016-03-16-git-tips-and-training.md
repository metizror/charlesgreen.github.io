If you use Git on the command line but missing the autocompletion goodness that you get from proper IDE's then look no further than [Git Autocompletion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash).

Trying to find an easy and effective approach to using git within a team. [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) might be your answer. It is a great simplification to the traditional git flow with a focus on delivering high quality and highly tested code. It's a double win if you use a service like Heroku and are able to push out multiple temporary versions of your apps for testing.
