I have some awesome news. Today I signed up for my 2nd marathon.

The first one was the 2010 Tokyo marathon. It's been a while but now it's time to dust off the shoes and get back to running again.

Next up is the [2nd Saitama International Marathon](http://saitama-international-marathon.jp/) on Sunday, November 12th.

It looks to be good fun. There are slots still available if you are up for a challenge.
