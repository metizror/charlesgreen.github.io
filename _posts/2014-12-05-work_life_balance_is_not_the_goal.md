### Are you looking or a well balanced life? No Thanks! I'm not.


### 12/6th - Edit/Update  

After publishing this short post yesterday I had a few good chats and realized that I too quickly jumped from the work life balance aspect of the title to more of a focus on how trying to become "well rounded". As such I wanted to add a few more thoughts on it.

I might be wrong but it seems that many people are living double lives with their personal life on one side and work life on the other. And generally speaking the goal is to successfully separate the two while finding some sort of time balance that keeps the people on each side happy and needs met.

While I'm guessing this approach works for many for me it's like having two bosses. No matter what you do one boss will always feel like they're not getting enough attention and the result will be a few layers of unneeded stress, constant worry, and a focus on something other than what is most important.

### A "Better" Approach (at least for me)

Personally, I subscribe to a different philosophy. First, I don't try to separate the two. Instead of mix them together and simply focus all my energy on whatever is at the top of my priority list at that time. This could be a walk in the park or delivering a project for a client.

Second, if this means that I'm ignoring someone or something of lessor importance I'm okay with it. If I find that I'm focusing in the wrong direction I quickly reprioritize and make the needed adjustments so that I am spending my time and energies where they should be.

In terms of work life balance, I do this without looking at my watch, checking the day, or counting the number of hours I worked that week. This also means that if I am a holiday gathering with family and I get a call from a client that I take the call. On the flip side, it could be 9AM on a Monday morning and something personal comes up that needs my attention then I adjust and refocus if it's more important.

Perhaps this is because I work for myself but then again, it is most likely the result of designing my life around maximizing upside while keeping things as simple, stress free, and rewarding as possible.


### "Well-balanced" screams mediocrity. I'd rather go for awesomeness.

It's like focusing and spending time to improve weaknesses. Instead I'd rather focus on maximizing the hell out of my strengths and working with people to balance things out with being awesome at what they do.  It just sounds like a better recipe to me.  

### What about at home?  
The same goes there. I think most people are usually attracted to people that help "balance" them out naturally. For example, one person is usually the "money and saving" person in the family while the other is generally good at generating income.

It's also like one person will want to run run run and keep going new places and seeing new things while the other likes to have a bit of a routine.

I think this is the perfect match. Both people do and focus on what they do best. Now that sounds like a recipe for awesomeness.

Today's post is very short because it doesn't need to be long.  Have an amazing day!
