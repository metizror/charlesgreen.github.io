The [TokyoJS Revival!](http://www.meetup.com/tokyojs/events/231504609/) is coming up fast on June 23rd.

There's a 4 speaker line up with one still to be announced. Yours truly, will be sharing tips and tricks on how to at least look awesome without getting fired.
Looks to be a great evening. They have the beer, you just need to bring the questions and fill the room.
