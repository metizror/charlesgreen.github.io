Whether it is business or tech the simple truth is that building stuff is awesome.  

We often get hung up with the quirks of a language or in which is the “best” technology but at the end of the day it’s important to remember that the only thing that really matters is that building stuff is awesome.

Take some time today to go and build something. Then share it and make the world a better place.

Until next time, build with passion.
