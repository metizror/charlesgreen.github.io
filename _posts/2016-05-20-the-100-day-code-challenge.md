Today starts my 100 days of nonstop code challenge. I am committed to writing, pushing, and contributing code to either my (GitHub profile)[https://github.com/charlesgreen/] or to another open source project where my GitHub account is still able to link to my work.

For me this is the first experience of it's kind and I am very much looking forward to it. It will give me a chance to really dig in deep with Ruby and Rails development. A chance to brush off a few skills and really dig deep into the finer things like creating gems, engines, and API's.

With each code push I will try to focus on something small but important ranging from lessons learned to new DSL's and metaprogramming.
