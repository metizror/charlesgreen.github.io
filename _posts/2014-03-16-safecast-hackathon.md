I had a great time today at the the [Safecast Hackathon](http://blog.safecast.org/2014/02/safecast-3-year/). It was a great chance to meet some amazing people with a lot of passion for the cause.

**_Safecast is a global project to empower people with data, primarily by mapping radiation levels and building a sensor network, enabling people to contribute and freely use the data collected._**  


If you haven't heard of [Safecast](http://www.safecast.org) I highly recommend checking them out.  

It took at bit of time to get my development environement up and running but I was able to submit my first minor pull request today which is always good.
Anyhow, a few of us were able to form a new team today and we will be focusing on improving, scaling, and extending the Ruby based API to support large data volumes and types of data.  

Well, that's all for today. I'll keep you posted.
