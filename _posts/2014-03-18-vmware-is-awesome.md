A few months ago I started a new job as a Software Developer and DevOps Engineer. One of the awesome parts of my job is that I get to play with a lot of new toys.  The first week on the job was like Christmas. I got the best MacBook Pro you can buy, an open network, and an AWS account, along with Apple and Microsoft developer subscriptions. Not to mention 2 x 27 inch monitors.  It truly was the wonderful commercialized holiday I've grown to love.  

For work I develop everything from Ruby on OS X to C# and PowerShell on Windows and everything in between. Developing on a Mac with VM's gives me the power I need with the familiarity of the command line that I've grown to love as I have a similar setup at home. In short, if setup properly it works well. If not, it's a nightmare.

Starting out with a new system I decided to try out a few new virtualization clients. Virtual Box was first on the list and as a free product I won't complain too much I found it buggy and still quite far from prime time as a desktop client.  I think the overall experience would have been much better if I was running older OS's on standard hardware. I then moved to Parallels. Itâ€™s a lot more polished but just as buggy. When trying to run Windows 2012 Server on OS X Mavericks it was nothing less than frustrating. For example, I initially tried importing the Virtual Box image via the wizard but that wasn't possible without going to the command line. I again ran into the same problems as I had with Virtual Box.

After a few weeks of hitting my head against my desk I tossed it out as well. It was time to go back to VMware Fusion. I've used VMware Fusion for the last 3 major releases and in comparison to the others it's awesome. So much so that I'm willing to pull cash out of my own pocket just so that I'm able to use it at work as well as at home.

As a quick recap this experience reminded me that when you have a good thing going it's best to keep doing what you've been doing instead of looking for better options.  

Until next time, happy coding!
