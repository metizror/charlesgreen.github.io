## Outrageously Large Dreams

For anyone that knows me personally they know that I have some outrageously large dreams and aspirations. So large that many people uncomfortable while others feel insecure. The remaining few generally get excited and realize that the world is full of endless possibilities that are available for anyone with the courage, hustle, and focus needed to push past countless failures until they reach them.  


## Reflection  
Recently, I’ve been reflecting and I realized that a few significant and admittedly challenging changes are needed in order to get myself back on track and pushing in the right direction. It’s a course correction and realignment of priorities if you will.  

## Decision
With this I’ve made the decision to devote my time and energy back to delivering value for clients, growing as a professional, and growing the community. Starting immediately!


If you haven’t done it in a while I highly suggest you take time to reflect and determine if what you are doing and spending your time on is truly important to you and in line with your dreams and aspirations.  This advice comes with a warning though. If followed through with, it will change your life.
