This is a quick post to let everyone know that I am launching a new blog called [Growth Apprentice](http://growthapprentice.com/).

I have no questions that Growth Engineering (aka Growth Hacking/ Marketing, etc.) is here to stay and I'm increasing it from an interest to the overall direction of my career. Heck it's even what I spend most of my free time reading and exploring these days.

[Growth Apprentice](http://growthapprentice.com/) is a new experiment to help me dig deeper and learn more about the exciting world of growth and marketing through the use of data an analytics. Come and join me, let me know what you think, and let's have a bit of fun.
