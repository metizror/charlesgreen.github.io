        <title>A Year Focused on Growth &amp; Impact</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-year-focused-on-growth--impact&quot;&gt;A Year Focused on Growth &amp;amp; Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years I’ve been focused primarily on increasing my technical skills such as AWS and Rackspace infrastructure automation and web service and tool development with Java and JavaScript. All in all, I believe this has helped me position myself well so that I can now take the next step and focus on business and impact growth for clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next year I will adjust my focus from technology and implementation to execution and growth. To judge my progress I will be using a standard set of growth metrics. What makes this unique is that I will judge the overall impact on how well I am able to contribute to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kiva.org/lender/simplycubed&quot;&gt;Kiva.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pencilsofpromise.org/&quot;&gt;Pencils of Promise&lt;/a&gt;. Both of which are not-for-profit organizations focused on improving the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days I will be sharing my goals and progress publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Work Life Balance is NOT the Goal</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;are-you-looking-or-a-well-balanced-life-no-thanks-im-not&quot;&gt;Are you looking or a well balanced life? No Thanks! I’m not.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;th---editupdate&quot;&gt;12/6th - Edit/Update&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After publishing this short post yesterday I had a few good chats and realized that I too quickly jumped from the work life balance aspect of the title to more of a focus on how trying to become “well rounded”. As such I wanted to add a few more thoughts on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might be wrong but it seems that many people are living double lives with their personal life on one side and work life on the other. And generally speaking the goal is to successfully separate the two while finding some sort of time balance that keeps the people on each side happy and needs met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m guessing this approach works for many for me it’s like having two bosses. No matter what you do one boss will always feel like they’re not getting enough attention and the result will be a few layers of unneeded stress, constant worry, and a focus on something other than what is most important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-better-approach-at-least-for-me&quot;&gt;A “Better” Approach (at least for me)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I subscribe to a different philosophy. First, I don’t try to separate the two. Instead of mix them together and simply focus all my energy on whatever is at the top of my priority list at that time. This could be a walk in the park or delivering a project for a client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, if this means that I’m ignoring someone or something of lessor importance I’m okay with it. If I find that I’m focusing in the wrong direction I quickly reprioritize and make the needed adjustments so that I am spending my time and energies where they should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of work life balance, I do this without looking at my watch, checking the day, or counting the number of hours I worked that week. This also means that if I am a holiday gathering with family and I get a call from a client that I take the call. On the flip side, it could be 9AM on a Monday morning and something personal comes up that needs my attention then I adjust and refocus if it’s more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is because I work for myself but then again, it is most likely the result of designing my life around maximizing upside while keeping things as simple, stress free, and rewarding as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;well-balanced-screams-mediocrity-id-rather-go-for-awesomeness&quot;&gt;“Well-balanced” screams mediocrity. I’d rather go for awesomeness.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like focusing and spending time to improve weaknesses. Instead I’d rather focus on maximizing the hell out of my strengths and working with people to balance things out with being awesome at what they do.  It just sounds like a better recipe to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-at-home&quot;&gt;What about at home?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes there. I think most people are usually attracted to people that help “balance” them out naturally. For example, one person is usually the “money and saving” person in the family while the other is generally good at generating income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also like one person will want to run run run and keep going new places and seeing new things while the other likes to have a bit of a routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is the perfect match. Both people do and focus on what they do best. Now that sounds like a recipe for awesomeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s post is very short because it doesn’t need to be long.  Have an amazing day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-work-life-balance-or-well-rounded-mean-to-you&quot;&gt;What’s “work life balance” or “well rounded” mean to you?&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>Unstoppable Desire to do Something Great</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you ever wake up in the middle of the night or hours before your alarm goes off with a craving? A desire so great that it’s all consuming. It’s like the desire to breath when you’ve been underwater for far too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve been cutting away at the distractions in my life and focusing more and more on my driving principles something unexpected happened. Not only has my focus gotten stronger but my overall desire and craving to succeed has as well.  This is the thirst that wakes me at night or after just a few hours of sleep. And while I have never needed much sleep in the past I now sleep deeper and wake up more rested on even less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-past-roadblocks&quot;&gt;Getting Past Roadblocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also got me thinking about childhood. I grew up asking myself what I wanted to do with my life or for a living.  Personally this has always been too difficult of a question to answer. First, because I like way to many things to pick just one. Second, for life just seemed like the risk of picking the wrong thing would have long lasting consequences. As a last resort I changed my question and started focusing on trying to find something that I could stand to do for the next 6 to 12 months instead. I also want into it with the expectation that afterwards I could change my mind and pick something new. While on the surface this sounds like commonsense it was a profound mental shift for me when it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sharping-skills&quot;&gt;Sharping Skills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have learned new skills including tech skills with programming everything from mobile and web apps to backend financial systems. Interviewed over 2000 engineers hiring just over 50. I also managed teams and taught approximately 850 mathematics and technology students a week for 5 years. Lastly, I’ve launched and ran a few different companies over the years and had to focus on the sales and delivery sides as well. And while all of these might seem out of place they have geared me up for my next challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unstoppable-drive&quot;&gt;Unstoppable Drive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s next you might ask? For me it’s growth. It’s on continually refining my skills and driving significant growth for every project and organization I work with.  It is with raising the bar and holding myself to a much higher standard and making the world a much better place along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Show Me The Docs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today’s a short quick post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you swap out “Money” for “Docs” I think this clip from Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) sums my feeling up quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been around software development for any length of time and have taken over projects I’m sure you’ve run into the undocumented project more than you’d care to count.  With tools like RDoc, YARD, and even good old XML style comments there’s simply no excuse for projects to be undocumented or to have old documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might take a culture shift but at least it’s better then being cursed at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the clip! I sure did.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Entrepreneur&#39;s Dilemma</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-focus-focus&quot;&gt;Focus, Focus, Focus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading a good article on Business and the challenge most of us face with focusing on what is most important and skipping the rest. With there never being enough time and money it’s getting increasingly more important to stay focused and keep pushing forward to market as quickly as possible while minimizing waste. Those that do not will be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chasing Dreams, Refocusing, and Pushing Forward</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;outrageously-large-dreams&quot;&gt;Outrageously Large Dreams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone that knows me personally they know that I have some outrageously large dreams and aspirations. So large that many people uncomfortable while others feel insecure. The remaining few generally get excited and realize that the world is full of endless possibilities that are available for anyone with the courage, hustle, and focus needed to push past countless failures until they reach them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflection&quot;&gt;Reflection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve been reflecting and I realized that a few significant and admittedly challenging changes are needed in order to get myself back on track and pushing in the right direction. It’s a course correction and realignment of priorities if you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;decision&quot;&gt;Decision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this I’ve made the decision to devote my time and energy back to delivering value for clients, growing as a professional, and growing the community. Starting immediately!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t done it in a while I highly suggest you take time to reflect and determine if what you are doing and spending your time on is truly important to you and in line with your dreams and aspirations.  This advice comes with a warning though. If followed through with, it will change your life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building Stuff Is Awesome</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether it is business or tech the simple truth is that building stuff is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often get hung up with the quirks of a language or in which is the “best” technology but at the end of the day it’s important to remember that the only thing that really matters is that building stuff is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take some time today to go and build something. Then share it and make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time, build with passion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Opinionated Software Rocks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ll take opinionated over indifferent every day of the week. In software development while coming from the Windows world I’d still take a single app with a very specific purpose like you find with Linux over larger more feature rich applications 9 times out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why you ask. The answer is quite simple. By focusing on a single purpose with limited use cases developers are able to remove bloat and the need to try and solve all the world’s problems with a single app. This in turn reduces the chances of bugs and unexpected behavior. It also simplifies long-term support and dependencies on other 3rd party applications. Last but far from least it gives the ability to mix and match functionality while reducing the chances of making mediocre software that does a lot of things but nothing really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tie that back to home, I’m using this core concept with all projects developed in SimplyCubed. It’s opinionated with well-defined ideas about how things should be done. Where possible projects will also be open so people can pick and chose the different parts they want to use without being tied to any single solution or implementation. Some pieces can be used while others are tossed out and replaced with something more suitable for their specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you working on an opinionated software project? If so, I’d like to hear from you at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/charles_green&quot;&gt;@charles_green&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>VMware Fusion is Awesome</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I started a new job as a Software Developer and DevOps Engineer. One of the awesome parts of my job is that I get to play with a lot of new toys.  The first week on the job was like Christmas. I got the best MacBook Pro you can buy, an open network, and an AWS account, along with Apple and Microsoft developer subscriptions. Not to mention 2 x 27 inch monitors.  It truly was the wonderful commercialized holiday I’ve grown to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For work I develop everything from Ruby on OS X to C# and PowerShell on Windows and everything in between. Developing on a Mac with VM’s gives me the power I need with the familiarity of the command line that I’ve grown to love as I have a similar setup at home. In short, if setup properly it works well. If not, it’s a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting out with a new system I decided to try out a few new virtualization clients. Virtual Box was first on the list and as a free product I won’t complain too much I found it buggy and still quite far from prime time as a desktop client.  I think the overall experience would have been much better if I was running older OS’s on standard hardware. I then moved to Parallels. It’s a lot more polished but just as buggy. When trying to run Windows 2012 Server on OS X Mavericks it was nothing less than frustrating. For example, I initially tried importing the Virtual Box image via the wizard but that wasn’t possible without going to the command line. I again ran into the same problems as I had with Virtual Box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks of hitting my head against my desk I tossed it out as well. It was time to go back to VMware Fusion. I’ve used VMware Fusion for the last 3 major releases and in comparison to the others it’s awesome. So much so that I’m willing to pull cash out of my own pocket just so that I’m able to use it at work as well as at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a quick recap this experience reminded me that when you have a good thing going it’s best to keep doing what you’ve been doing instead of looking for better options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time, happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Global “Hack for Safecast” Hackathon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a great time today at the the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.safecast.org/2014/02/safecast-3-year/&quot;&gt;Safecast Hackathon&lt;/a&gt;. It was a great chance to meet some amazing people with a lot of passion for the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Safecast is a global project to empower people with data, primarily by mapping radiation levels and building a sensor network, enabling people to contribute and freely use the data collected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.safecast.org&quot;&gt;Safecast&lt;/a&gt; I highly recommend checking them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took at bit of time to get my development environement up and running but I was able to submit my first minor pull request today which is always good.
Anyhow, a few of us were able to form a new team today and we will be focusing on improving, scaling, and extending the Ruby based API to support large data volumes and types of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s all for today. I’ll keep you posted.&lt;/p&gt;
