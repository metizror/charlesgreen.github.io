It might sound a bit strange but having a good worklow makes life so much better. 

In business this is having a well structured way of communicating, setting expectations, getting things done, measuring results and finally closing the loop with feedback. 

In software development and engineering world this tends to focus in on having the right systems in place for tracking everything from capturing requirements with user stories to implementation, quality control, and then finally into the support phase. 

When the systems in place are well oiled and running smoothly the world is a highly productive and wonderful place but when they're not in place or when their are gaps life becomes painful. And the more people you add to the mix the worse it gets until the underlying problems are addressed. 

If you catch yourself in this situation. I believe the only way to come out is to force time for improvements. This might result in pushed off deadlines and getting backed up on urgent tasks but in the end the only way for the situation to improve is to focus first on filling the gaps at the core of the problem. After that the temporary backup on work will take care of itself.

The area that I am trying to improve today has to do with Code Reviews. To help with this I am experimenting with a few tools to help teams work better together. For many project I have been doing code reviews after code has been pushed into the initial shared dev branch on projects however with [Review Ninja](https://app.review.ninja) I am looking at ways to improve code reviews earlier in the the process. Using [Git Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) helps to set a standard for the team to work with. Part of the challenge however it to make sure that everyone on the team has the needed Git skills are fully understand the process.
