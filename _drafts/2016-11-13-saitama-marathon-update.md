I had a great race in Saitama and to make things even better I was able to finish the race in less than 6 hours.  

As this marathon was only a day trip away this post will be a bit shorter than the trip to Toyama. I'll also touch on a couple lessons learned and give a quick recap of how my new [Garmin Forerunner 230](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-230/prod523893.html) worked out. I'll also bullet point up coming races touching on the [Nagano Marathon](http://www.naganomarathon.gr.jp) in April 2017 and a [Spartan Race](https://www.spartan.com/) (obstacle course) that I'm thinking of doing in 2017 (TBD).


## Destination Saitama

Sitting about 1 hour straight north of Meguro, Saitama is a bit of hike but definitely doable for a day trip.


## Toyama Marathon

With a lot of small peaks and valleys the course is far from boring but the climbs in the second half does make it a bit challenging. With a cut off time of 6 hours this race was definitely more challenging than the Toyama marathon and required me to shave more than 40 minutes off my time in order to finish in the allocated time.

## Planned Improvements - Nagano Preparation

Over the last couple of races my times have needed to increase drastically in order to finish on time. Starting at 7 hours Toyama was generous and I could focus on simply finishing the race. Then came Saitama at 6 hours. Still doable but definitely a stretch at my current health and weight.  Next up is the Nagano Marathon at 5 hours. I now have no choice but to shed some weight and work on both my endurance as well as speed drills. To help with this I'm looking at [McMillan Running](https://www.mcmillanrunning.com/) for either a custom training plan or monthly online coaching as this race will be my first real test and I want to give it my all.
