I got a great question today and I'd like to share my thoughts and ideas about it with you. I'd also like to hear and you're ideas on the topic.

## Why Am I Running Marathons?

A friend asked me why am I running marathons when I'm frankly out of shape and need to drop 20 - 30kg.

While this wasn't the first time I've thought about this it is the first time I've been asked. This leads me to think that others might wonder the same question but simply haven't asked.

After thinking about it for a bit it really comes down to 3 reasons. First, its a big goal which I've now completed twice. The first time was in the 2010 Tokyo Marathon (6:36) and just 2 weeks ago at the 2016 Toyama Marathon (6:37).

Looking at my times it's easy to see that getting down to a sub 5 or 6 hour marathon will take time and be an even bigger challenge. Personally I find this exciting, small goals just don't do it for me.

Second, it's a fixed deadline and you can't cram for a marathon. I use this to help me put in the time to train because regardless come the big day I will I will show up. The more I train the less it will hurt and the easier it will be. If I don't train properly then it simply provides the needed mental stick I need to push myself before the next race.

Last of all, I like the look people give me when I tell them I did it. It's a cross between disbelief and craziness. And better yet, it provides a great but unintended side benefit. Generally speaking it helps me to quickly understand the type of people I'm speaking with. Simply by telling the person that they too could run a full marathon with a little training and enough time. Confident people tend to agree whereas others simply provide reasons they can't. In this case, a marathon can also be substituted with any other seemingly challenging task.
