I got a great question today and I thought it would be a good chance to share it with you. I'd also like to hear your thoughts on the topic.

## Why Do I Run Marathons?

A colleague asked me why am I running marathons instead of starting small and working my way up to the big leagues as I'm frankly still out of shape and need to drop a good 20 - 30kg.

While this wasn't the first time I've thought about the question it surely is the first time I've been asked. This leads me to think that others might wonder the same thing but simply haven't asked as most people just look at me with disbelief.  

It all comes down to 3 reasons. First, it's a big goal which I personally find exciting and compelling. And knowing myself I wouldn't work nearly as hard for a small goal.

Looking at my times at the 2010 Tokyo Marathon (6:36) and 2016 Toyama Marathon (6:38) it's easy to see that getting down to a sub 5 or even 6 hour marathon will take tremendous effort and dedication.

Second, it's a fixed deadline that you can't cram for. It's not like a math or spelling test which you can cram for the night before or a term paper that you can pull an all nigher to complete. You simply need to put in the time and mileage in order to make progress. Besides, I don't like pain so the more I train the less it will hurt and the more fun it will be.

Last of all, I like the look people give me when I tell them I did it. It's a cross between disbelief and craziness. Better yet, it provides a great but unintended side benefit. Generally speaking it helps me to quickly understand I'm surrounding myself with. It allows me to quickly sort out the supportive and confident people from the rest which in itself more than enough reason to do it.

If you run marathons, why do you do it? If not, why not give it a try?
