I had a great October wrap up with running the Toyama Marathon on Halloween. To make things even better it was refreshing to see a more traditional side of Japan for a few days but I was caught a bit off guard to see quite a few locals donning Halloween costumes for a night on the town.

In this post I'd like to recap a bit of my trip, touch on a few lessons learned from my second marathon, and outline upcoming races. Yes, that's races with an 's'. I've just recently signed up for the [Nagano Marathon](http://www.naganomarathon.gr.jp) in April 2017 with another either full or half marathon sneaking in sometime between now and then.

## Toyama Marathon

For any first time marathoners or for anyone looking for a wonderful and well run event with a 7 hour cut off time then Toyama is a great marathon. This year's race had about 13,000 runners. There seemed to be just as many volunteers and way more spectators than I expected. All I can guess is that everyone in Toyama and the surrounding areas decided to come out and join us for the day. For that I'm grateful. Thank you.

## Destination Toyama

Separate from the marathon I found Toyama to be a good fun and very visitor friendly. It was also a good change from day to day life in Tokyo with a lot of small but noticeable differences. Space, trees, grass, and a lot of rivers were the first things I noticed however after a bit of time I started to notice things like trams instead of trains and a lot more people driving than walking.  The only downside that I found, if you can call it that, is the lack of pubs or sports bars to catch a game and chat with friends. And for those that I did find, they all opened after 7:00PM.

## Race results

As for my specific results in the race I fell flat in training and allowed my schedule to get in the way of training. As such, while I am happy with finishing I'm disappointed in my time of 6:37:59. Compared to my time in the Tokyo Marathon in 2010 I was about 2 minutes slower. I chalk this up mostly to insufficient training and a lack of equipment. I completed the first 20km in 3:10 and I was able to finish the race strong however my pace got away from me during the second half when my iPhone and Apple Watch battery died in just 3 hours. I found that without being able to constantly monitor my pace I was all over the place. Other than that I felt great, finished the race with a smile on my face.

### Planned Improvements - Saitama Marathon Preparation

As such I will go out and buy a new [Garmin vívoactive® HR](https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/wearables/wearables/vivoactive-hr/prod538374.html)

Thanks everyone for your help and I look forward to continuing my training along with you. I'm down to 9 days and counting for the Saitama Marathon. I'll keep you posted on my progress.
